### Hey there! <img src="https://github.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/blob/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="35px">

My name is Amit and I'm pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering. I have a passion for learning and currently I'm working with Python frameworks like Flask and Django to strengthen my understanding in Backend Development. I occasionaly write to share my learning and experiences with a particular tech that I've worked with. You can see one of them here [Medium](https://medium.com/@amitcooldutta279/a-beginners-guide-to-confusion-matrix-machine-learning-101-77280db06c4b) or here [Dev.to](https://dev.to/_amitdutta7/a-beginner-s-guide-to-confusion-matrix-machine-learning-101-3m36). Don't forget to give some Claps or Love. 😛
